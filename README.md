## mPulse Mobile Code Interview

Create a React app with CRUD functionality around patients, including:

A form to add new patients with the following fields:
First Name (required)
Last Name (required)
Phone Number (required)
Date of Birth
Email
A list view of all patients

Notes:

Feel free to use any open-sourced libraries
This app can be purely frontend
Each CRUD operation should be possible
How will you handle validation?
